# Kernel Knowledge

Use this skill as the knowledge layer for GPU-kernel optimization loops. It does
not run the loop; pair it with `humanize-gen-plan`, `humanize-refine-plan`, or
`humanize-rlcr`.

## Knowledge Root

The installer hydrates this path:

```text
{{KERNEL_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT}}
```

If the path is not hydrated, use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` when running as a
Claude Code plugin, or locate the repo containing `knowledge/index.json`
and `references/kernel-source-catalog.md`.

## Required Use

Before writing a plan or choosing a kernel edit:

1. Read `knowledge/README.md`.
2. Read `knowledge/routing/topics/index.md`.
3. Read `knowledge/references/index.md` to choose the detailed reference layer.
4. Pick and read the most relevant topic pages, for example:
   - normalization or fused norm: `knowledge/routing/topics/normalization.md`
   - elementwise fusion: `knowledge/routing/topics/activation-fusion.md`
   - GEMM or tensor cores: `knowledge/routing/topics/matmul-gemm.md`
   - attention or KV cache: `knowledge/routing/topics/attention.md`,
     `knowledge/routing/topics/kv-cache.md`
5. Pick and read relevant framework pages, usually starting with:
   - `knowledge/routing/frameworks/sglang.md` for SGLang work
   - `knowledge/routing/frameworks/vllm.md`, `flashinfer.md`, `flash-attention.md`,
     `cutlass.md`, `deepgemm.md`, `triton.md`, `tilelang.md`,
     `cute-dsl.md`, `quack.md`, `tilekernels.md`, `thunderkittens.md`,
     `veitner-blog.md`, `colfax-research.md`, or `cuda-blog-kernels.md`
     when the topic points there
6. Read the matching deep source guide under
   `knowledge/references/source-guides/` for PyTorch, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang, vLLM,
   FlashAttention, FlashInfer, CUTLASS, DeepGEMM, Triton, TileLang, CuTe DSL,
   QuACK, DeepSeek TileKernels, ThunderKittens, Veitner blog/code, Colfax
   blog/code, or CUDA blog companion kernels.
7. For PR-driven production repositories, read the matching PR guide under
   `knowledge/references/prs/` in the same knowledge pass. PR evidence and
   source evidence are paired: PRs explain why an optimization was made and
   source guides show where the current implementation and transferable code
   live. Do not query PRs for source-only repositories such as PyTorch,
   DeepSeek TileKernels, CUDA sample repos, blog/code companion repos, puzzle
   repos, source catalogs, and repositories with fewer than 10 selected CUDA
   optimization PRs; inspect their source guide and current code directly
   instead.
8. Each PR entry records what changed, where it came from, changed paths, and
   the optimization recipe to test. The PR pages keep all filtered CUDA
   optimization PRs, not a curated top-N; each entry must have CUDA/NVIDIA
   target evidence, a real kernel/source change, and an optimization/performance
   mechanism. Search both the PR page, when applicable, and the source guide for
   the kernel family, dtype, backend, architecture, and bottleneck terms before
   choosing an edit.
9. If the bottleneck is known but the best source repository is unclear, read
   `knowledge/references/prs/by-topic/index.md` and the matching topic page.
10. Read `knowledge/references/prs/open-watchlist.md` only for volatile current
   ideas, and re-check linked GitHub PRs before trusting code or benchmark
   claims.
11. For implementation/profiling mechanics, read the copied AKO4ALL references:
   - CUDA C++: `knowledge/references/ako4all/cuda-cpp-kernel-reference.md`
   - Triton: `knowledge/references/ako4all/triton-kernel-reference.md`
   - CUTLASS/CuTe prior art:
     `knowledge/references/ako4all/cutlass-cpp-kernel-reference.md`
   - CuTe DSL:
     `knowledge/references/ako4all/cute-dsl-kernel-reference.md`
   - Profiling: `knowledge/references/ako4all/profiling-debugging-reference.md`
   - H100: `knowledge/references/ako4all/architectures/sm90-optimization-guide.md`
12. Read `references/kernel-source-catalog.md` before broader research.
13. During plateau research or when a source is blog-driven, read
   `knowledge/references/blogs/index.md` and the matching blog page before
   opening companion code.

Keep the initial pass small. For a concrete target kernel, read one topic page,
one framework page, one source guide, and one PR page only if that framework is
PR-driven. Use by-topic pages, the open PR watchlist, and broad source catalogs
after the first benchmark/profile result or when the target source is unclear.

## Research Rules

- Pair production PRs with current source code, tests, and benchmarks before
  blogs or articles when the repository is PR-driven. For source-only
  repositories, including repositories with fewer than 10 selected CUDA
  optimization PRs, skip PR lookup entirely and use source guides plus direct
  code scans.
- Treat `knowledge/references/prs/` and
  `knowledge/references/source-guides/` as the paired primary corpus for CUDA
  optimization ideas for PR-driven repositories. Treat source guides and source
  catalogs as the primary corpus for source-only repositories. Use blogs to
  explain or extend source evidence, not as the first stop.
- Read order during plateau expansion is paired: merged repository PR pages plus
  matching source guides, cross-repository by-topic PR pages plus relevant
  source guides, open PR watchlist plus current source scan, then blog/code
  references. For source-only repositories, replace PR pages with direct source
  files, symbols, tests, and benchmarks.
- Candidate implementation language is user-directed. Use CUDA C++/PTX,
  Triton, CuTe DSL, TileLang, CUTLASS/CuTe, ThunderKittens,
  torch.compile/Inductor, or a framework-specific kernel stack when the user or
  baseline calls for it.
- If the user does not specify a language, prefer the active baseline kernel's
  implementation system before inventing a new stack.
- Baseline kernels can seed candidate implementations. Copy or adapt baseline
  code into the standalone repo only when license and attribution allow, and
  record exact source path/URL, commit, license/notice, copied files, and delta
  in the source ledger and lineage.
- If the user explicitly asks for a from-scratch kernel or says not to use the
  baseline implementation, do not copy, adapt, or pattern-match the baseline
  kernel code. Use that baseline only for correctness, benchmark, profiler, and
  API comparison.
- When optimizing a kernel from a framework repo, keep that source checkout
  read-only for standalone work unless the user explicitly asks for an in-place
  patch.
- For standalone optimization work, create a fresh git repo with its own torch
  binding, correctness tests, benchmarks, attempt ledger, optimization ledger,
  and profiling artifacts.

## Loop Ledger Expectations

Record every source-derived idea with:

- source repo or local knowledge file
- exact PR number when available
- exact source path, symbol, or URL
- hypothesis tested
- measured result
- do-not-reread key

Only add rows to the optimization ledger for correct versions that improve
performance. Keep a separate attempt ledger for every tried version, including
versions that fail correctness or do not improve speed.

After two consecutive weak rounds (<1% improvement over the prior best), perform
a research expansion before editing again: read at least 50 new code-first
sources before prose sources and log them with do-not-reread keys. Count PR
diffs, changed kernel files, linked tests, and benchmark files as separate
code-first sources only when each one is recorded in the ledger.
